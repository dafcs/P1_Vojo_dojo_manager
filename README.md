# P1_gym_manager

This README.md relates to the Project 1 titled 'gym_manager'.

# ### SETUP ### #

Note: Every command needs Enter to be pressed in order to run.

**Installation necessary software(MAC)**

psycopg2 - https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/

python - https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/

flask - https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-flask


**Open the terminal**
1. Open the Spotlight Search (cmd + space bar)
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press enter

**Creating a folder**
The terminal should start in ~ which is the home path.

4. Create a folder by pasting:
mkdir project_daniel_dimoes

You can change the name as you see fit (e.g. mkdir foldername)

**Navigate to the folder**
Now you will need to step in to that folder
5. Navigate to the folder by pasting:
cd project_daniel_dimoes
The ~ should now be showing 'project_daniel_dimoes'

**Setting up the GIT repository**
Once in the folder, create a GIT repository.
6. Initiate the Git repository by pasting:
git init

The 'project_daniel_dimoes' should now have git:(main) in front of it.

**Accessing the files**
Still in the same folder
7. Pull (or access) the files by pasting:
git clone git@github.com:dafcs/P1_gym_manager.git

**Creating the database**
8. Create the database by pasting:
    createdb gym_manager
This can be done from any point

**Generate the necessary tables**

9. Once the database has been created, generate the respective tables by pasting:
psql -d gym_manager -f db/gym_manager.sql

note: this needs to be ran from the parent folder of db (or the folder in which db is in), if this is not 'project_daniel_simoes' then follow below steps:

While in the folder project_daniel_simoes start by pasting:
ls

this should provide a list of all the items inside the folder project_daniel_simoes

if there is a folder inside that one you will need to navigate to that folder, you can do this by writing cd foldername.
e.g. if the folder is called 'P1_gym_manager' you would write cd P1_gym_manager

**Running flask**
In order to run flask paste in to terminal:
flask run

# Troubleshooting 

Useful navigation commands:

**Finding the currect path**
pwd 
(this will print working directory)

**Returning to ~ (home directory)**
cd ~
cd
(this will change directory to home)

**listing all items in a folder**
ls

**navigating to the correct folder**
cd foldername
(this will change directory to the one specified)
